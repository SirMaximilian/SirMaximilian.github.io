        &Tab; Hello, my name I Gilbert and I am a senior Computer Engineering
        student at Fresno State. I'm interested in areas of embedded systems,
        autonomous vehicles, and machine learning. I am interested in web
        development because so much of our time now a days is spent in front of
        a computer o the internet. I think it is a good idea to know more about
        what is going on in the background as well as being able to create a
        website of my own. For this website I would like to use it to showcase a
        project that ive completed and maybe even act as a digital resume.
