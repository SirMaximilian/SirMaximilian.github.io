Hello, my name is Gilbert Barr and I am a senior Computer Hardware Engineering student at Fresno State. I really interested in the area of embedded systems, digital logic, and CPU design.
I am also pursuing a minor in computer science with an interest in machine learning, machine vision, and software engineering. I am learning in these areas because I am interested in autonomous
vehicles and automation and I would love to pursue a career in these fields. During my time at Fresno State I have gained a lot of knowledge in my classes towards this goal but I have also devoted
some of my time outside of class working on projects and extracurricular clubs. My most notable time spent has been with Fresno State's Unmanned Systems Research Team where I've had the opportunity to work
on multiple projects involving drones and other vehicles. With my extensive use of technology I've managed to become very familiar with computers so I also have a position as a student assistant with Technology Services
IT group on campus. There I've have also spent a lot of time not only working with computers but helping fellow staff and school faculty across campus with day to day operations. Outside of school and clubs
I also spend some of my own time enjoying my hobbies such as gaming, building and flying my drones, and playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends.
